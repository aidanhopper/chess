* Chess 2.0 made with pygame
This is the second version of my chess program with a multitude of backend improvements in order to scale better. The file methods.py is designed to be expandable beyond its original use case. There are many useful methods in the file including a fen parser.

* End goal
The end goal for this project is to have an expandable chess system which can be used to create a chess bot.

* TODOs
- Add pawn promotion and castling support for backend
- Add check to en passant so that it only displays when pawn is able to perform en passant
- Create playable chess front end application.
- Create a bot to play chess against.
